# Covariance

1.Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. It tells us whether two variables tend to increase or decrease together

Positive Covariance: When both variables increase or decrease together, it indicates a positive relationship. For example, as the    temperature rises, ice cream sales may increase.

Negative Covariance: When one variable increases while the other decreases, it indicates a negative relationship. For example, as the temperature increases, the amount of heating used in a house might decrease.

Zero Covariance: If there is no relationship between the two variables, the covariance will be zero, meaning the variables do not affect each other.

Mathematically, covariance is calculated as the average of the product of the differences between each variable's value and its mean.
